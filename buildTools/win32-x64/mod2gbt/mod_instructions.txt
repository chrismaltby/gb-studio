                           EFFECTS
                           -------

0xy - Arpeggio. Only channels 1, 2 and 3.

Ann - Volume envelope. Only channels 1, 2 and 4. 
	  A0F = fade out note fast. AF0 = fade in note fast. A02 = fade out slow.
	  A00 & new song = Reset envelope. Output divided by 2, 2-F = 1-7

Bnn - Jump to pattern in order nn (in hexadecimal).

Cnn - Sets the volume to nn (in hexadecimal). Valid values from 00h to 40h.
      Channel 3 can only be set to 0%, 25%, 50% and 100%. Others can be set
      in a range of 0-Fh.

Dnn - Ends this pattern and jumps to position nn (in decimal) in next pattern.
      If used the last step of a pattern it will jump two patterns, not one!

E8n - Sets the panning to n (in hexadecimal). 
      Left --- Both --- Right
      0123   456789AB    CDEF

ECn - Cut Note after n ticks. If n > speed or n = 0, it won't work.

Fnn - Sets speed to nn (in hexadecimal). Valid values are 01h to 1Fh.
      The higher the value, the slower the song. BPM speed not supported.

Effects are limited in channel 3 when setting a new note (only half of them
are available). It shouldn't be a problem since the effects that can't be
used are control commands that can be used by other channels.

**********************************************************************
* You should set volume and instrument whenever you put a new note!! *
* You should set instrument whenever you change volume in CH3!!      *
* You should always put an instrument whenever you use arpeggio!!    *
