For Linux users:
sdcc is designed to install into /usr/local, and currently needs to be
recompiled to install into any other location.  To install:

* Extract the binary kit to a temporary directory.  This will create a
new directory called 'sdcc' in the temporary directory.
    cd ~
    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    tar xzf path/to/binary/kit/sdcc.tar.gz

* Change to the sdcc directory and copy all files to /usr/local
    cd sdcc
    cp -r * /usr/local

This will install sdcc into /usr/local/bin/sdcc, support files into
/usr/local/share/sdcc, and documentation into
/usr/local/share/doc/sdcc.

You can test the install by entering:
    /usr/local/bin/sdcc -v

This should return sdcc's version number.
 

For Windows 9X/NT/2000 users:
sdcc is designed to install into c:\sdcc and currently needs to be
recompiled to install into any other location.  To install:

* Open sdcc-2.3.0-i586-mingw32-msvc.zip in WinZip
* Extract all files to c:\, making sure to check 'Use folder names'

You can test the install by opening a DOS box and entering:
    c:\sdcc\bin\sdcc -v

This should return sdcc's version number.
