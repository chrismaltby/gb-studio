Warning! Only single-precision is actually implemented.  This file
won't really be much use until double-precision is supported.

However, once that is done, this file might eventually become a
replacement for libgcc1.c.  It might also make possible
cross-compilation for an IEEE target machine from a non-IEEE
host such as a VAX.

If you'd like to work on completing this, please talk to rms@gnu.ai.mit.edu.

** 05/01/91 -- V1.0 -- first release to gcc mailing lists
** 05/04/91 -- V1.1 -- added float and double prototypes and return values
**                  -- fixed problems with adding and subtracting zero
**                  -- fixed rounding in truncdfsf2
**                  -- fixed SWAP define and tested on 386

** The following are routines that replace the libgcc soft floating point
** routines that are called automatically when -msoft-float is selected.
** The support single and double precision IEEE format, with provisions
** for byte-swapped machines (tested on 386).  Some of the double-precision
** routines work at full precision, but most of the hard ones simply punt
** and call the single precision routines, producing a loss of accuracy.
** long long support is not assumed or included.
** Overall accuracy is close to IEEE (actually 68882) for single-precision
** arithmetic.  I think there may still be a 1 in 1000 chance of a bit
** being rounded the wrong way during a multiply.  I'm not fussy enough to
** bother with it, but if anyone is, knock yourself out.
**
** Efficiency has only been addressed where it was obvious that something
** would make a big difference.  Anyone who wants to do this right for
** best speed should go in and rewrite in assembler.
**
** I have tested this only on a 68030 workstation and 386/ix integrated
** in with -msoft-float.
