Macro system design

The purposes of the macro system are:
1.  Provide a way to target other assemblers than asxxxx, such as the
GB IAR or rgbds assemblers.
2.  Provide a way to target multiple similar processors at a relatively
simple level from one backend, such as the gbz80 and z80.
3.  Provide a way to dynamically build a command line for any spawned
processes.
4.  Provide a way for the backend to convientely access volatile global data
such as the source file name or current function name.  This is mainly
to get around assembler limitations.

Examples are:
1.  Different assemblers use different forms for immediate values.
 Compare:
            ld a,#0x00
            ld a,$00
            ld a,#$00
    Different assemblers use different forms for certain constructs.
 Compare:
            .ds 2
            DS  2
            DEFS 2

2.  Some concepts, such as prolog and epilogue can be combined.  
 Compare:
            push        ix
            ld          ix,#0
            add         ix,sp

            ld          hl,0(sp)

3.  Various paths such as include or library paths may change at run
time.

4.  Need to use the function name in a temporary variable name as the
assembler doesn't support temporary local labels
 Compare:
            1$:
            _func_0001:

Types of data:
1.  Static for a given starting set of parameters, such as target
assembler or path

          {zero}        -> #0, $0, 0x00
          {sdccinclude} -> c:/sdcc/include, /usr/share/sdcc/include

2.  Static for a given starting set of parameters, but include
arguments inside them

          {immeda}       -> #0x%02X, $%02X
          {areaa}        -> .area %s, SECTION "%s"

3.  Volatile throughout the run time with no parameters

          {currfuncv}    -> _func

4.  Volatile with arguments
          {templabeldef} -> {currfuncv}_%d:

Rules:
1.  Macros are surrounded by curly braces {}.  
2.  Curly braces cannot appear in any data.
3.  Macros will be recursively expanded.  The expansion cannot be
cyclic.
4.  Macros used as values to arguments will be recursively expanded.
Any macros used as argument values cannot require arguments.  If they
do the arguments will not be evaluated.

Problems:
1.  There is no type checking or usage checking due to things being
evaluated at run time.  This could be verified by using a separate
perl script to statically evaluate the strings.
