# GBDK Example
This example Requires GBDK-2020 4.2.0 or higher (due to using `vsync()`)

PNG images placed in the res/hicolor folder will get automatically converted and compiled.

To use them, include the automatically generated header file (based on the png filename) and then use the `hicolor_start()` and `hicolor_stop()` functions.

For the current GBDK example ISR implementation there is a limit of 6 sprites per line before the hi-color timing breaks down and there start to be background artifacts.
