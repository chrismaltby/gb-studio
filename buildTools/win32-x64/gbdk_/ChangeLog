gbdk3-2.95-3
	* Stopped lcc with sdcc from leaking .cdb files all across
	  /tmp.
	* Optimised < and > for 16 bit varibles.
	* Added a new lexer to sdcc.  Compiling files with large
	  initalised arrays takes 31% of the time (well, at least
	  samptest.c does :)
	
gbdk3-2.95-2
	* Added model switching support
	   --model-medium uses near (16 bit) pointers for data, and
	   banked calls for anything not declared as 'nonbanked'
	   --model-small uses near (16 bit) pointers for data and
	   calls.  Nothing uses banked calls.  'nonbanked' functions
	   are still placed in HOME.  Libraries are under lib/medium
	   and lib/small.
	* Added the gbdk version to 'sdcc --version'
	* Changed the ways globals are exported, reducing the amount
	  of extra junk linked in.
	* Turned on the optimisations in flex.  Large constant arrays
	  like tile data should compile a bit faster.
	
gbdk3-2.95
	* Fixed 'a >> c' for c = [9..15]
	* Fixed 'a << c' for c = [9..15]
	* no$gmb doesn't support labels of > 32 chars.  The linker now
	trims all labels to 31 chars long.
	* Fixed wait_vbl for the case where you miss a vbl
	* Fixed + and - for any type where sizeof == 2 and one of the
	terms was on the stack.  This includes pointers and ints. Fixes
	the text output bug in the examples.  Should be faster now as
	well.  Note that + and - for longs is still broken.
	* Fixed the missing */ in gb.h
	* Added basic far function support.  Currently only works for isas
	and rgbasm.  See examples/gb/far/*
	* bc is now only pushed if the function uses it.  i.e. something
	like:
      	int silly(int i) 
      	{
		return i;
      	}	
	will not have the push bc; pop bc around it.
	* Better rgbasm support.  Basically:
      	   o Use "sdcc -mgbz80 --asm=rgbds file.c" for each file.c
           o Use "sdcc -mgbz80 --asm=rgbds crt0.o gbz80.lib gb.lib file1.o file2.o..."
	
	to link everything together.  The .lib files are generated using
	astorgb.pl and sdcc to turn the gbdk libraries into something
	rgbds compatible.
	The libraries are _not_ fully tested.  Trust nothing.  But give it
	a go :)
	* Ran a spell checker across the README and ChangeLog

gbdk3-2.94
	* Fixed 
		#define BLAH  7  // Unterminated ' error
	  in sdcpp
	* Fixed
		SCY_REG += 2, SCY_REG -= 5
	  (add and subtract in indirect space) as they were both quite broken.
	* externs and static's now work as expected.
	* You can now specify which bank code should be put into using a
	  #pragma e.g:
		#pragma bank=HOME
	Under rgbds and asxxxx putting code in the HOME bank will force
	the code into bank 0 - useful for library functions.  The most
	recent #pragma bank= will be the one used for the whole file.
	* Fixed an interesting bug in the caching of lit addresses
	* Added support for accessing high registers directly using the
	'sfr' directive.  See libc/gb/sfr.s and gb/hardware.h for an
	example.  It should be possible with a bit of work to make high
	ram directly usable by the compiler; at the moment it is
	experimental.  You can test sfr's by enabling USE_SFR_FOR_REG=1
	* Added remove_VBL etc functions.
	* Documented the libs - see the gbdk-doc tarball distributed
	seperatly.
	* Two dimensional arrays seem to be broken.

gbdk3-2.93
	* Added multi-bank support into the compiler - The old -Wf-boxx
	and -Wf-baxx options now work
	* Has preliminary support for generating rgbds and ISAS compatible
	assembler.  Try -W--asm=rgbds or -W--asm=isas.  The ISAS code is
	untested as I dont have access to the real assembler.
	* RSH is fixed
	* AND is fixed
	* The missing parts of 2.1.0's libs are there.  Note: They are
	untested.
	* The dscan demo now fully works (with a hack :)
	* There is a bug with cached computed values which are later used
	as pointers.  When the value is first used as a BYTE arg, then
	later as a pointer the pointer fails as the high byte was never
	computed and is now missing.  A temporary fix is to declare
	something appropriate as 'volatile' to stop the value being
	cached.  See dscan.c/bombs() for an example.
  
gbdk3-2.92-2:
	* win32 only.  Takes care of some of the install bugs, including:
	   - Now auto detects where it is installed.
		This can be overridden using set GBDKDIR=...
	   - Problems with the installer (now uses WinZip)
	   - Problems with the temp directory
		Now scans TMP, TEMP, TMPDIR and finally c:\tmp
	   - cygwin1.dll and 'make' are no longer required
	   	gbdk is now built using mingw32 which is win32 native
		make.bat is automagically generated from the Makefile
	   - I've reverted to using WORD for signed 16 bit etc.
		GBDK_2_COMPAT is no longer required.

gbdk3-2.92:
	* All the examples now work (with a little bit of patching :)
	* Fixed problem with registers being cached instead of being
	marked volatile.
	* More register packing - should be a bit faster.
	* You can now install somewhere except c:\gbdk | /usr/lib/gbdk
	* Arrays initialised with constant addresses a'la galaxy.c now
	work.
	* Fixed minor bug with 104$: labels in as.
	* Up to 167d/s...
