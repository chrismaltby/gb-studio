Setup:
------------

=== Windows ===

* Unzip to a folder of your choice (which you've probably already done)
    Suggested location: c:\gbdk\

* Recommended but not required: Add the gbdk 'bin' sub-directory to your
  system path using the Windows System control panel

* Open a command line and compile the examples by running "compile.bat" in
  the "examples\gb" sub-directory:
    cd c:\gbdk\examples\gb
    compile.bat


=== Linux ===

* Unzip to a folder of your choice (which you've probably already done)
    Suggested location: /opt/gbdk/

* Recommended but not required: Add the gbdk 'bin' sub-directory to your shell path
    Run from command line (only lasts for that session): export GBDKDIR=/opt/gbdk
    Or add that to your shell defaults (permanent)

* Open a command line and compile the examples by running "make" in
  the "examples\gb" sub-directory:
    cd /opt/gbdk/examples/gb
    make
