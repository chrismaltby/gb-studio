Algorithm: Greedy orthogonal bipartition of RGB space for variance
       minimization aided by inclusion-exclusion tricks.
       For speed no nearest neighbor search is done. Slightly
       better performance can be expected by more sophisticated
       but more expensive versions.

The author thanks Tom Lane at Tom_Lane@G.GP.CS.CMU.EDU for much of
additional documentation and a cure to a previous bug.

Free to distribute, comments and suggestions are appreciated.
