Note:

The LCC front end / compiler driver this LICENSE file is attached to 
is a small subset of the original LCC compiler distribution included 
in versions of GBDK before it switched to the SDCC compiler. Now only 
the LCC front end / compiler driver is included with GBDK as a 
convenience interface and wrapper to the SDCC compiler.

The license below is the one used by the original authorsof LCC. There have
been various contributors via the GBDK and GBDK-2020 projects since then.

The non-commercial clause below is with regard to using the LCC code
itself (of which very little remains), and is not related to using code
which is passed through LCC in it's role as a front-end compiler driver.

The modern incarnation of the original project can now be found at:

The file was formerly named "CPYRIGHT"

lcc is not public-domain software, shareware, and it is not protected
by a `copyleft' agreement, like the code from the Free Software
Foundation.

lcc is available free for your personal research and instructional use
under the `fair use' provisions of the copyright law. You may, however,
redistribute lcc in whole or in part provided you acknowledge its
source and include this CPYRIGHT file. You may, for example, include
the distribution in a CDROM of free software, provided you charge only
for the media, or mirror the distribution files at your site.

You may not sell lcc or any product derived from it in which it is a
significant part of the value of the product. Using the lcc front end
to build a C syntax checker is an example of this kind of product.

You may use parts of lcc in products as long as you charge for only
those components that are entirely your own and you acknowledge the use
of lcc clearly in all product documentation and distribution media. You
must state clearly that your product uses or is based on parts of lcc
and that lcc is available free of charge. You must also request that
bug reports on your product be reported to you. Using the lcc front
end to build a C compiler for the Motorola 88000 chip and charging for
and distributing only the 88000 code generator is an example of this
kind of product.

Using parts of lcc in other products is more problematic. For example,
using parts of lcc in a C++ compiler could save substantial time and
effort and therefore contribute significantly to the profitability of
the product. This kind of use, or any use where others stand to make a
profit from what is primarily our work, requires a license agreement
with Addison-Wesley.  Per-copy and unlimited use licenses are
available; for more information, contact
