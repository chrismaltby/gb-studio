/** @file gb/drawing.h
    All Points Addressable (APA) mode drawing library.

    Drawing routines originally by Pascal Felber
    Legendary overhall by Jon Fuge : https://github.com/jf1452
    Commenting by Michael Hope

    Note: The standard text printf() and putchar() cannot be used
    in APA mode - use gprintf() and wrtchr() instead.

    Note: Using drawing.h will cause it's custom VBL and LCD ISRs
    (`drawing_vbl` and `drawing_lcd`) to be installed. Changing
    the mode (`mode(M_TEXT_OUT);`) will cause them to be de-installed.

    The valid coordinate ranges are from (x,y) 0,0 to 159,143.
    There is no built-in clipping, so drawing outside valid
    coordinates will likely produce undesired results (wrapping/etc).

    ----

    __Important note for the drawing API :__

    The Game Boy graphics hardware is not well suited to frame-buffer
    style graphics such as the kind provided in `drawing.h`.
    Due to that, __most drawing functions (rectangles, circles, etc) will
    be slow__ . When possible it's much faster and more efficient
    to work with the tiles and tile maps that the Game Boy hardware is
    built around.
