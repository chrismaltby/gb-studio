- Game engine completely rewritten to make less top down rpg genre specific
- New engine performance optimisation [@RichardULZ](https://github.com/RichardULZ)
- Merge events where the only difference was values being hard coded or coming from a variable like "Move To" and "Move To Using Variables" by adding button next to input that allows switching between variable, value or a new property type. Also allows mix of hard coded and variable values in single event. Feature known internally as union types
- Custom events updated to support union types [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas)
- Add additional Animation Speed option "None". Setting this will prevent actor from animating at all. Static actors will now cycle through frames while moving unless this value is set.
- Add support for macOS full screen mode

### Fixed

- Fix bug where deleting a custom event definition that was used multiple times in a single script would only delete the first instance of the event
- Fixed Ctrl + Z and Middle click behavior on Windows [@RichardULZ](https://github.com/RichardULZ)
- Fix custom events issue where some events wouldn't show their variables in the custom event parameters [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas)
- Lots of bug fixes / helping get the open beta build ready [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas) and [@RichardULZ](https://github.com/RichardULZ)
- Prevent actor sprites from overlapping dialogue boxes
- Fix issues when trying to use more than 256 sprites in a single game
- Fix issues when saving progress if project contained more than 256 scenes

### Changed

- Pushing actors now uses a 16px x 16px collision box rather than 16px x 8px, this will make Sokoban puzzles work better but could cause issues if you depended on the old behaviour
- Scene connections now by default only shows connections to/from the currently selected scene. The old default is available in "View/Show Connections/All"
- When not in color mode the Game World section will display images in the same palette as the emulator
- Event "Attach Script To Button" now doesn't persist between scenes by default, old functionality is still available using a new "persist" checkbox but new events that depend on sprite memory layout may have issues when persist is enabled (Projectiles/Attack/Actor Set Sprite Sheet)
- Top Down scenes now use the last pressed direction button for current movement direction improving controls when using a keyboard

### Removed

- Remove "Double Speed Mode" settings checkbox, when Color is enabled this is now enabled automatically
- Remove actor "Movement Type" dropdown, replaced with "On Update" script. Existing actors set to Random Walk / Random Rotation will be migrated automatically
